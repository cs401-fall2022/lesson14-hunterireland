  <h1>Typescript for Javascript Programmers</h1>
  <p>
    Maybe you need some more structure in your life. JavaScript reminds you of the kid you were in high school: 
    wild and free, nobody could control you, or tell you what to do. But you're grown up now! You've learned
    that you need to be a little more careful, and that a little structure is good for you. You're ready, not
    for therapy, but for TypeScript. 
  </p>
  <p>
    TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript's features,
    and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript's type system. For example, JavaScript provides language
    primitives like string and number, but it doesn't check that you've consistently assigned these. <em>Typescript does</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since you're older now, you love great deals, so how about buy one get one free? Your existing working JavaScript code 
    is also TypeScript code. How you like them apples? The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected 
    behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs. This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing on 
    its type system.
  </p>

  <h2>Just Figure it Out! (Types by Inference)</h2>
  <p>
    If you want something done, do it yourself. Right?
  </p>

  <p>
    TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating
    a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.

    By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. 
    This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. 
  </p> 

  <h2>Do It Yourself (Defining Types)</h2>
  <p>
    Sure, types can be inferred. But don't you like to boss people, err, programs around sometimes? Sometimes, you'd like
    a little bit of strict enforcement, because not everybody loves surprises. To cover these cases, TypeScript supports 
    an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.

    Include example and some details...
  </p>

  <h2>Impose Your Will (Composing Types)</h2>
  <p>
    With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with unions, 
    and with generics.
  </p>
  <h3>Holy Matrimony (Unions)</h3>
  <p>
    With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. *Include example*
  </p>

  <h3>You're so Basic (Generics)</h3>
  <p>
    Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. 
    An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains. *Include example*
  </p>

  <h2>Don't Judge a Book by its Cover (Structural Typing)</h2> 
  <p>
    One of TypeScript's core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called
    “duck typing” or “structural typing”. In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered
    to be of the same type.
